# Day 14

Part 2, I looked at the output until I detect it is looping and look at the seen_row_start value being printed out
I look for when the cycle repeats again, then subtract to get the cycle length.
Then use the following formula to calculate the index that you have calculated already: (1000000000 - `seen_row_start`) mod `cycle_length` + `seen_start`

Then look up the value in being referred to the calculated index
